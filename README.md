Since i have learned the basic of Machine learning, i want to keep upgrading the project 
in order to make it as good as possible.

Next step is creating a dataset to make predictions with new values and see how the model behaves on predictions
with new values out of the original dataset.

After that, i will be comparing the model behaviour when using cross validation, considering we have a short dataset
the behaviour should be correct.
